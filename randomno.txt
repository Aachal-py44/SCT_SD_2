Build a program that generates a random number and challenges the user to guess it. the program should prompt the user to input their guess, compare it to the generated number.

Functions:

new_game():
Generates a new random number between 1 and 100.
Clears the guess entry field.
Updates the feedback label to prompt the user for a guess.
check_guess():
Attempts to convert the user's input in the guess entry to an integer.
Checks the guess against the random number:
If too low, updates the feedback label with a hint.
If too high, updates the feedback label with a hint.
If correct, congratulates the user, displays a success message box, and starts a new game.
In case of invalid input (not a number), updates the feedback label with an error message.

GUI Elements:

root: The main application window with title "Number Guessing Game".
prompt_label: Label prompting the user to enter their guess.
guess_entry: Entry field for the user to input their guess.
guess_button: Button labeled "Guess" that triggers the check_guess() function.
feedback_label: Label that provides feedback to the user based on their guess.
new_game_button: Button labeled "New Game" that triggers the new_game() function.

Overall Flow:

The program starts a new game by generating a random number.
The user enters their guess in the entry field.
Clicking the "Guess" button triggers the check_guess() function.
The function validates the user's input and compares the guess with the random number.
Based on the comparison, the function updates the feedback label and potentially starts a new game or displays a success message.
